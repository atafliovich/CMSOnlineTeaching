        <h3>Livestreaming</h3>
		
		<ul>
            <li>BB colaborate</li>
            <ul>
                <li>intergrated into quercus</li>
                <li>record for later use, screensharing, breakout groups</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Zoom <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">(link)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>many onlne tutorials, easy to use</li>
                <li>record for later use, screensharing, breakout groups, remote access</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ultimately Zoom has more fetures and is easier to learn to use/trouble shoot, while BB colaborate is better
                if the proffesor wants to keep everythung on quercus (and let students easily find recordings of past lectures on zoom)
            </p>
		</ul>

        <h3>Assignment Collection</h3>
		
		<ul>
            <li>Quercus Assignments</li>
            <ul>
                <li>intergrated into quercus</li>
                <li>can be easily used to get files from students</li>
                <li>can add anotaions and comments</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Markus</li>
            <ul>
                <li>can be easily used to get files from students</li>
                <li>can add anotaions and comments</li>
                <li>show results of tests on collected software</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Crowd Mark <a href="https://crowdmark.com/" target="_blank">(link)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>can be easily used to get individual pages from collected assignment</li>
                <li>very easy to clearly show where student lost marks and add anotaiosn to student work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Markus is good for collecting programming assignments, while crowd mark is good for collecting written work
                (such as math homework). As for quercus, it is already used by many students and as such would simplify their 
                lives if it was used to collect assignments.
            </p>

		<h3>Editing Software</h3>
		
		<ul>
            <li>Openshot <a href="https://www.openshot.org/" target="_blank">(link)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Free</li>
                <li>Simple and easy for beginners to use</li>
                <li>Can use to do all basic video editing (trim, animation, speed control, etc)</li>
                <li>Not good for more complicated video editing</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Davinci resolve (free version) <a href=https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/ target="_blank">(link)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>visual effects, motion graphics, color correction and audio post-production</li>
                <li>Useful for more complicated editing</li>
                <li>Harder for beginners to use</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

            <li>Sony vegas pro <a href=https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/ca/vegas-pro/ target="_blank">(link)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Industry-leading software</li>
                <li>Useful for making extremely well edited lecture</li>
                <li>Costs money (depending to which version is acquired)</li>
                <li>can be complicated and hard to learn</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For most proffessors Openshot will be the best choice since it has all the features needed for 
                simple editing ad its easy to use for beginners. While Davinci resolve may be needed for professors 
                who want to do more with their lectures but most (if not all) will not need any of its special features.
                Finally, unless a professor is trying to edit a complicated video sony vegas pro is outside of the 
                requirements.
